Planar Buffer

Simple geometric buffer (non-geodesic). Utilizes the units of the geometry of the input feature.
To perform a geodesic buffer use a projection such as stateplane that is equidistant.
Output Type: OpenLayers Polygon feature.
Accepted geometry types: Point, Linstring, Polygon.

example script:

	calls a buffer on feature at a distance of 100*feature geomtry units

		BufferFeature = geoPro.buffer(feature, 100);


Erase

Takes two input polygons. The output feature is a polygon representing areas in the first input feature that are not shared with the second input feature.
Output Type: OpenLayers Polygon feature.
Accepted geometry types: Polygon

example script:

	featureOne is the feature to be erased, featureTwo is the erasing feature.
	
		erasedFeature = geoPro.erase(featureOne,featureTwo);

Centroid

Utilizes a center of mass algorithm to produce the center of an input polygon weighted by the polygon's area.
Output Type: OpenLayers Point feature
Accepted Geomtry Types: Polygon.

example script:

	feature is an input polygon.

		centroid = geoPro.getCentroid(feature);

Point in Polygon

Utilizes a ray-casting algorithm to determine if an input point feature is within an input polygon feature
Output Type: boolean.
accepted Geometry Types: Point, Polygon.

example script:

	pointFeature is the input point, polygonFeature is the input polygon. The result is a boolean value indicating whether or not the point feature is within the polygon feature.

		inPolygon = geoPro.pointInPolygon(pointFeature,polygonFeature);
